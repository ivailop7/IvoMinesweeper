## IvoMinesweeper

The a simple minesweeper game based on the infamous Windows game. The exercise of building it is to improve my usage of React Hooks and not use Redux.

The blog post on the exercise of building the game is [available here](https://www.ivaylopavlov.com/building-a-minesweeper-game-using-react-hooks)

The game is available to [play here](minesweeper.ivaylopavlov.com).
